Project Barista is the culmination of an extraordinary effort to fund, design and build a tool for open source license and vulnerability management suitable for deployment within a large organization.  From the beginning, our intention was to release the first production version as an open source project so the wider community could get involved, benefit from our efforts, and help move the project forward.  To that end, I would like to recognize those individuals who were instrumental to the team that pulled it all together.
